    [`bug 1616424 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1616424>`_]
    Python build-in exception was raised if create request token or access token
    request from client with invalid request parameters, invalid signature for example.
    The implementation is hardened by showing proper exception and displaying the
    failure reasons if existent.
