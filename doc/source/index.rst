Keystone, the OpenStack Identity Service
========================================

Keystone is an OpenStack service that provides API client authentication,
service discovery, and distributed multi-tenant authorization by implementing
`OpenStack's Identity API`_.

This documentation is primarily targeted towards contributors of the project,
and assumes that you are already familiar with Keystone from an `end-user
perspective`_; however, end users, deployers, and operators will also find it
useful.

.. _`OpenStack's Identity API`: http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/
.. _`end-user perspective`: http://docs.openstack.org/

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree. Also see the :doc:`community` page for other ways to interact with the
community.

Related Identity Projects
=========================

In addition to creating OpenStack's Identity Service, the Keystone team also
provides a `WSGI middleware`_, as well as `Python client library`_.
